# :open_file_folder: Open the MJML file and do the following using the tools you have installed:


### 1. Open the MJML template using the VSCode Extension

* Open up the template file and the preview 
* Analyse the tools and figure out how to export a template to HTML using MJML & Handlebars

### 2. Update the MJML code with Handlebars syntax

* Figure out how to fill out the variable positions [] with data
* Then figure out how to display all products dynamically within the order data

You can use Handlebars helpers if you feel like it is required.

### 3. There was feedback from the stakeholders

:point_right: Feedback:  We need to include insurance and other sub-products. The designers said that it can be formatted like the main product but should be 24px offset to the right from the main product. This will indicate that it is a sub-product and not a main one. 

* Figure out how to implement the feedback
* There are also background blocks that the customer is not supposed to see - indentify and filter them out in Handlebars

You can use Handlebars helpers if you feel like it is required. 

### 4. Format the project into a Github repository for review

* Export the template end result in HTML format
* Write a short summary of what you did to achieve the goal, which tools you used and what challenges you faced. Include it in your repository
* Push latest version to Github Repository and share it with mikk.parg@telia.ee

### 5. Contact us if there are any questions

* If you find something that is wrong with the assignment then let us know! We can look into it and validate if something seems off
